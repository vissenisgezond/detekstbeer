I know the feeling! I keep having new ideas and change my mind from time to time, but that&#039;s ok. We evolve and develop new passions. That plan sounds amazing, by the way, I truly hope it works out :)]]></description>

My plan is to do what I love at a certain period of time, but also learn new professions that excite me and don&#039;t force myself to choose only one.]]></description>
