So much so, that people who are close to me literally call me &#8220;Perfectionist&#8221; at every opportunity they get. I can&#8217;t blame them, really; I need the font size to be exactly right and the location of every element has to be pixel perfect. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Calculating something with Excel or Google sheets, that would have taken me just two minutes to do, often takes me a lot longer just because I\u2019m playing with table colors and making sure my graphs look <em>extra<\/em> pretty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s one of my best qualities, but also kind of my worst because it can cause some delay when trying new things. When I shot the video about this topic, I actually fought the feeling that that video is a piece of crap just because I didn\u2019t have the perfect audio or the fact that my camera was actually my phone.&nbsp;But in the end, I was happy I was doing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a tendency to procrastinate. And I know that a big part of it is due to the fact that my first try won\u2019t be as I imagine it; ie &#8211; perfect. So I try to learn as much as I can before I actually take a chance. Crazy, I know. I\u2019ve missed many opportunities to create something I care about just because I was scared it wouldn\u2019t be perfect, So I\u2019ve decided to confront this fear head-on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The goal of this article:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Finally, shoot, edit &amp; publish my first video.<\/li><li>Help people like me get started on that project they wanted to work on for a while.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started right, we need to&#8230;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #1: (Accept the fact) It\u2019s going to <em>suck<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes the feeling of failure, and some of us try to avoid this feeling at all costs. I know I do. But failure is part of success, not the opposite of it. Before I can start working on something new, I <em>need<\/em> to be aware of the fact that nothing is perfect the first time around, and that even a partial \u201cfailure\u201d can count as a win. And at this point, you\u2019re probably thinking, like me, It\u2019s easier said than done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I\u2019ve been in front of a camera hundreds of times, whether it\u2019s been commercials, tv shows, my digital course, or YouTube videos, making that video still made me kind of nervous because It was actually the first time I was doing something like <em>this<\/em> &#8211; Something <em>personal<\/em> &amp; so <em>public<\/em>. Doing something that for the first time is not going to be perfect, and I needed to understand it and accept it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on the video showed me just how much time and energy I was wasting just to make sure my first video on my channel was perfect. But just like riding a bike, it\u2019s ok to fall the first time you try it. You get back on the bike and try again. It might be uncomfortable at first, but you\u2019ll get better with time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #2: Understand your motivations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding why we care so much about making things perfect can help us deal with the anxiety of doing something faulty or otherwise \u201csub-standard\u201d. In other words, <strong>knowing you have a problem is the first step in finding a solution<\/strong>. It\u2019s easier to win a battle when you know who your enemy is. But I\u2019m just a guy on the internet, I\u2019m not a professional.&nbsp;So I wanted to know what is the experts\u2019 position regarding perfectionism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts say many perfectionistic tendencies are rooted in fear and insecurity. I didn\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m unprofessional by making a video that looks bad, but understanding where that fear wass coming from and what my goal was, actually helped me want to do something about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #3: Adjust your standards<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I started to shoot the video, I\u2019ve made countless rewrites to the script and even walked in the sun to a park nearby to find the perfect spot to shoot. That was only the start. I was pretty nervous because I couldn&#8217;t find the perfect spot to shoot the video; I needed the perfect amount of shade, the perfect amount of sun &#8211; I need the perfect shot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sure I got it right the first time, I brought everything I needed. The script, a tripod, and a mic for my phone. But just as I was adjusting my camera, ie &#8211; my phone, I realized I forgot to bring a USB-C adapter for my microphone. I could have just started filming then and there, but I wanted the audio to be amazing or, at least, not crappy. That meant walking all the way back home, getting that damn adapter, and walking all the way back to the park just to shoot the perfect shot with the perfect audio, which was never going to happen anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, I was already tired, but I wasn\u2019t going to give up yet.&nbsp; Eventually, I found the imperfect place, where I could <em>finally<\/em> shoot my video. Got everything just right to start shooting (again), and after an hour of just walking around, I started filming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But, as you already know, I\u2019m a perfectionist.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as I started filming, my inner perfectionist kicked in. I did countless takes just to get that one perfect shot. Seriously, I\u2019ve done <em>way too many<\/em>. Truth is, I need to understand that some things that I care about, most people don\u2019t even care about. The things that I was trying to make in that video, most people won\u2019t even notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the people who are going to watch the video, don\u2019t really care if I have a light background or a dark one. People don\u2019t really care about how the content is delivered, they really care about the content itself.&nbsp;I need to understand that my standards are not as important to the audience as they are to me and that maybe, just maybe &#8211; I might be pushing myself too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #4: Make a Checklist &amp; Prioritize<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a checklist is very important, but it&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. You need to prioritize its items <em>effectively<\/em>.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s take the making-of that video, for example. Shooting that video was part of my checklist, but before I started using the camera, I needed to write what I\u2019m going to talk about. Otherwise, I would just ramble about random things that have <em>nothing<\/em> to do with the point I was trying to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings me to my next point:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #5: Taking action is more important than planning (Sometimes)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>American Statesman Dwight Eisenhower once said,<\/p>\n\n\n<style>.elementor-14546

he makes a pretty good point. But&#8230; planning is <em>also<\/em> nothing if you don\u2019t take any action. That is why tip #5 is the most important one: <strong>Take Action<\/strong>. I\u2019ve spent the days before the shooting procrastinating intensively, with the excuse of \u201cI\u2019m working on it\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watching that tutorial, reading that article, and sometimes just not getting out of bed. Everything to keep me from trying something new that would never be exactly the way I want it.&nbsp;Eventually, I realized that if I\u2019m not going to do anything soon, I might not do anything at all. Thankfully I had a good friend and accountability buddy to push me forward when I didn\u2019t feel like taking action. So, Rami,&nbsp; if you\u2019re reading this, thanks, man!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can never be perfect. We\u2019re not machines, and even machines tend to break every now and then, needing to be fixed by imperfect people. That being said, I believe we shouldn\u2019t be afraid of &#8211; or refrain from &#8211; perfectionism completely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/thefarbear.blog\/most-powerful-tool\/\">When under control<\/a>, perfectionism can be a great asset, even becoming the driving force to better ourselves. We just need to be careful, not to let that drive turn into a burden. Plus, Now that I\u2019ve finally created something, I know <em>exactly<\/em> what my strengths are and what I need to improve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that makes the entire process a lot more interesting.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a creative person, I find myself struggling with making sure everything is \u201cPerfect\u201d.
