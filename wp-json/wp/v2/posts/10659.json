Literally. I was inspired by a Facebook post titled &#8220;30 conclusions &amp; tips for a 30th birthday&#8221;. The general vibe of the post ranged from dramatic, yet inspiring, to cute and entertaining. I enjoyed reading the post and the tips the author shared, so I thought to myself that it&#8217;s a nice idea to do something similar in honor of my upcoming twenty-fourth birthday. Only the version I thought of was supposed to be filled with jokes and amusing anecdotes &#8211; a form of a parody one might say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Quick disclaimer<\/strong><br>This post is heavily influenced by<a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/buffett-focus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> James Clear&#8217;s original article<\/a>. If you like it, be sure to show him some love too. Happy reading!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Then my twenty-fifth birthday came and went and I still haven\u2019t posted the funny post. Not only have I not written the post, suddenly the post seemed meaningless to me. Is this what I want to do at 25? Just something funny? &#8211; Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like making people laugh, but I&#8217;m sure something more significant can be done in honor of an age that sums up a quarter of a century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decided to do something different. I&#8217;ll write down 25 goals I intend to achieve this year and use this post as a reference. I started searching the web to get inspired and came up with a really interesting <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Warren_Buffett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Warren Buffett<\/a> method called &#8220;<em>The 25\/5 Technique<\/em>&#8220;. The same technique he created to achieve personal goals. The method works something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Create a list of everything you want to accomplish<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you need to create a list of 25 goals\/tasks that you want to achieve this year &#8211; without fear and without filtering. Write it all down. Here are some things I wrote down for myself:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Give a lecture<\/li><li>Learn to play the ukulele<\/li><li>Write a book<\/li><li>Go skydiving<\/li><li>Gain Weight<\/li><li>Read more books<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on. As I wrote more and more things I wanted to do, new things emerged that I had not thought of before. All sorts of ideas I&#8217;ve heard from friends over the years and thought to myself &#8220;Ah, cool!&#8221; But I never put too much thought into them. It&#8217;s important not to &#8220;edit&#8221; anything at this point in the list. Just write down whatever comes to mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I started my life, I wrote down some guidelines. I didn&#8217;t want to write something boring like &#8220;buy an electric scooter&#8221;. When you think about it, buying something is not such an amazing goal (or at all); with a little financial planning, it can be achieved without a lot of problems. So to make sure I write interesting and worth-while goals that will advance me later, I set up these three rules:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It must be an action or an achievement<\/li><li>It must be something measurable (for example: instead of writing &#8220;read more books&#8221;, write &#8220;read 10 books&#8221;)<\/li><li>I can&#8217;t list anything that can be obtained by purchasing it<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, in your list, you can think of rules that are more suitable for you, but these are great guidelines. still here? Go write some goals!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Choose the 5 most important goals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have all our goals written down, we need to go through the list and choose the 5 most important goals. Not the easiest to do &#8211; <strong>the most important ones<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Wait up<br><\/strong>Before you continue to the next step, you should make sure to finish steps 1 &amp; 2 if you haven&#8217;t already.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. 20 More to go&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do we do now that we have the 5 most important goals? Completely ignore the other 20 goals. Yup, I&#8217;m serious. There is nothing more distracting than thinking about other goals that are not the most important. In order not to get lost among all the things I wrote down, I rewrote all my goals, in order of priority. Only when I finish the top 5 tasks will I move on to the next 5 tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to read more about Buffett&#8217;s technique?
