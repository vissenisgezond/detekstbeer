<p>As a creative person, I find myself struggling with making sure everything is “Perfect”. It’s one of my best qualities, but also kind of my worst.</p>

<p></p>


<p>Perfectionism has always been a part of my life. So much so, that people who are close to me literally call me &#8220;Perfectionist&#8221; at every opportunity they get. I can&#8217;t blame them, really; I need the font size to be exactly right and the location of every element has to be pixel perfect. But it doesn’t stop there. Calculating something with Excel or Google sheets, that would have taken me just two minutes to do, often takes me a lot longer just because I’m playing with table colors and making sure my graphs look <em>extra</em> pretty.</p>



<p>It’s one of my best qualities, but also kind of my worst because it can cause some delay when trying new things. When I shot the video about this topic, I actually fought the feeling that that video is a piece of crap just because I didn’t have the perfect audio or the fact that my camera was actually my phone.&nbsp;But in the end, I was happy I was doing it.</p>



<p>I have a tendency to procrastinate. And I know that a big part of it is due to the fact that my first try won’t be as I imagine it; ie &#8211; perfect. So I try to learn as much as I can before I actually take a chance. Crazy, I know. I’ve missed many opportunities to create something I care about just because I was scared it wouldn’t be perfect, So I’ve decided to confront this fear head-on.</p>



<h2>The goal of this article:</h2>



<ol><li>Finally, shoot, edit &amp; publish my first video.</li><li>Help people like me get started on that project they wanted to work on for a while.</li></ol>



<p>To get started right, we need to&#8230;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip #1: (Accept the fact) It’s going to <em>suck</em></h2>



<p>Nobody likes the feeling of failure, and some of us try to avoid this feeling at all costs. I know I do. But failure is part of success, not the opposite of it. Before I can start working on something new, I <em>need</em> to be aware of the fact that nothing is perfect the first time around, and that even a partial “failure” can count as a win. And at this point, you’re probably thinking, like me, It’s easier said than done.</p>



<p>Even though I’ve been in front of a camera hundreds of times, whether it’s been commercials, tv shows, my digital course, or YouTube videos, making that video still made me kind of nervous because It was actually the first time I was doing something like <em>this</em> &#8211; Something <em>personal</em> &amp; so <em>public</em>. Doing something that for the first time is not going to be perfect, and I needed to understand it and accept it.</p>



<p>Working on the video showed me just how much time and energy I was wasting just to make sure my first video on my channel was perfect. But just like riding a bike, it’s ok to fall the first time you try it. You get back on the bike and try again. It might be uncomfortable at first, but you’ll get better with time.</p>



<h2>Tip #2: Understand your motivations</h2>



<p>Understanding why we care so much about making things perfect can help us deal with the anxiety of doing something faulty or otherwise “sub-standard”. In other words, <strong>knowing you have a problem is the first step in finding a solution</strong>. It’s easier to win a battle when you know who your enemy is. But I’m just a guy on the internet, I’m not a professional.&nbsp;So I wanted to know what is the experts’ position regarding perfectionism.</p>



<p>Experts say many perfectionistic tendencies are rooted in fear and insecurity. I didn’t want people to think I’m unprofessional by making a video that looks bad, but understanding where that fear wass coming from and what my goal was, actually helped me want to do something about it.</p>



<h2>Tip #3: Adjust your standards</h2>



<p>Before I started to shoot the video, I’ve made countless rewrites to the script and even walked in the sun to a park nearby to find the perfect spot to shoot. That was only the start. I was pretty nervous because I couldn&#8217;t find the perfect spot to shoot the video; I needed the perfect amount of shade, the perfect amount of sun &#8211; I need the perfect shot.</p>



<p>To make sure I got it right the first time, I brought everything I needed. The script, a tripod, and a mic for my phone. But just as I was adjusting my camera, ie &#8211; my phone, I realized I forgot to bring a USB-C adapter for my microphone. I could have just started filming then and there, but I wanted the audio to be amazing or, at least, not crappy. That meant walking all the way back home, getting that damn adapter, and walking all the way back to the park just to shoot the perfect shot with the perfect audio, which was never going to happen anyway.</p>



<p>At that point, I was already tired, but I wasn’t going to give up yet.&nbsp; Eventually, I found the imperfect place, where I could <em>finally</em> shoot my video. Got everything just right to start shooting (again), and after an hour of just walking around, I started filming.</p>



<h3>But, as you already know, I’m a perfectionist.</h3>



<p>As soon as I started filming, my inner perfectionist kicked in. I did countless takes just to get that one perfect shot. Seriously, I’ve done <em>way too many</em>. Truth is, I need to understand that some things that I care about, most people don’t even care about. The things that I was trying to make in that video, most people won’t even notice.</p>



<p>Most of the people who are going to watch the video, don’t really care if I have a light background or a dark one. People don’t really care about how the content is delivered, they really care about the content itself.&nbsp;I need to understand that my standards are not as important to the audience as they are to me and that maybe, just maybe &#8211; I might be pushing myself too hard.</p>



<h2>Tip #4: Make a Checklist &amp; Prioritize</h2>



<p>Having a checklist is very important, but it&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. You need to prioritize its items <em>effectively</em>.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s take the making-of that video, for example. Shooting that video was part of my checklist, but before I started using the camera, I needed to write what I’m going to talk about. Otherwise, I would just ramble about random things that have <em>nothing</em> to do with the point I was trying to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which brings me to my next point:</p>



<h2>Tip #5: Taking action is more important than planning (Sometimes)</h2>



<p>American Statesman Dwight Eisenhower once said,</p>


<style>.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-121df01c, .elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-121df01c > .elementor-background-overlay{border-radius:10px 10px 10px 10px;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-121df01c{margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;padding:0em 0em 0em 0em;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb:not(.elementor-motion-effects-element-type-background) > .elementor-column-wrap, .elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-column-wrap > .elementor-motion-effects-container > .elementor-motion-effects-layer{background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:cover;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated >  .elementor-background-overlay{background-color:#0c0a0b;opacity:0.66;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated, .elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated > .elementor-background-overlay, .elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-background-slideshow{border-radius:10px 10px 10px 10px;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated{transition:background 0.3s, border 0.3s, border-radius 0.3s, box-shadow 0.3s;margin:50px 50px 50px 50px;padding:50px 50px 50px 50px;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated > .elementor-background-overlay{transition:background 0.3s, border-radius 0.3s, opacity 0.3s;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-c51375b .elementor-blockquote__content{color:#ffffff;font-family:"Permanent Marker", Sans-serif;font-size:30px;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;line-height:1.4em;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-c51375b .elementor-blockquote__author{color:#ffffff;font-size:16px;font-weight:400;text-transform:uppercase;font-style:italic;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-c51375b .elementor-blockquote:before{color:var( --e-global-color-primary );font-size:calc(1px * 100);}@media(min-width:1025px){.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb:not(.elementor-motion-effects-element-type-background) > .elementor-column-wrap, .elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-column-wrap > .elementor-motion-effects-container > .elementor-motion-effects-layer{background-attachment:scroll;}}@media(max-width:1024px){.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated{margin:30px 80px 30px 80px;padding:40px 40px 40px 40px;}.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-c51375b .elementor-blockquote__content{font-size:26px;}}@media(max-width:767px){.elementor-14546 .elementor-element.elementor-element-3ca9ffbb > .elementor-element-populated{margin:30px 0px 30px 0px;padding:40px 40px 40px 40px;}}</style>		<div data-elementor-type="section" data-elementor-id="14546" class="elementor elementor-14546" data-elementor-settings="[]">

<p>-And he makes a pretty good point. But&#8230; planning is <em>also</em> nothing if you don’t take any action. That is why tip #5 is the most important one: <strong>Take Action</strong>. I’ve spent the days before the shooting procrastinating intensively, with the excuse of “I’m working on it”.</p>



<p>Watching that tutorial, reading that article, and sometimes just not getting out of bed. Everything to keep me from trying something new that would never be exactly the way I want it.&nbsp;Eventually, I realized that if I’m not going to do anything soon, I might not do anything at all. Thankfully I had a good friend and accountability buddy to push me forward when I didn’t feel like taking action. So, Rami,&nbsp; if you’re reading this, thanks, man!</p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>We can never be perfect. We’re not machines, and even machines tend to break every now and then, needing to be fixed by imperfect people. That being said, I believe we shouldn’t be afraid of &#8211; or refrain from &#8211; perfectionism completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://thefarbear.blog/most-powerful-tool/">When under control</a>, perfectionism can be a great asset, even becoming the driving force to better ourselves. We just need to be careful, not to let that drive turn into a burden. Plus, Now that I’ve finally created something, I know <em>exactly</em> what my strengths are and what I need to improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that makes the entire process a lot more interesting.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Hol&#8217;up a minute!</strong><br>This is an introduction post I wrote in an Israeli Facebook group, &#8220;The New World People&#8221;, founded by Lior Frankle. It was later translated to English, so some humor or sarcasm might not got translated that well. All in all, the core idea still stands, and I hope you enjoy this post 🙂</p></blockquote>



<p>Hi there, I&#8217;m Michael.</p>



<p>I design things; my mom thinks it&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>



<p>So after breaking the ice of this &#8220;introduction post&#8221; &#8211; Hello everyone 🙂 My name&#8217;s Michael, I&#8217;m 24 years old, I build websites and study animation in the Israeli Animation College. Before I continue, I have to ask you a question: Does anyone remember what they wanted to be when they grew up, when they were a kid?</p>



<p>Think about it, I&#8217;ll get back to that in a second.</p>



<p>When I was sixteen, I decided I wanted to be an animator. It was so cool &#8211; no one had any idea what they wanted to do in life; most friends my age didn&#8217;t know what they wanted to do on the weekend and I had already had it all figured out.&nbsp; I drew all my life and it was just felt like the right digivolution. The most stressful question you can think of at that age, and I had the coolest answer.</p>



<p>Then at the age of 21, I was discharged from the army and a question came up. And another. And another. Everyone started asking me lots of questions. On school. And on a degree. And where will I live, <em>am I</em> planning a big trip after the army, <em>where</em> am I planning my big trip after the army? Did I get vaccinated? Am I allergic to a specific medicine? Wait, what&#8217;s my blood type anyway? (&#8220;Hello Mom? What&#8217;s my blood type? Everything&#8217;s fine, I&#8217;m just asking for a friend&#8221;), do you have a girlfriend? Why not? Why are you not traveling? Have you started planning your future? Wait, you didn&#8217;t sign-up for school yet?! What kind of career will you have? Maybe quit your job as a waiter and do something meaningful with your life? Stop messing around and find a stable job! What do you <em>want</em> to do? Is there money in it? You&#8217;re smart, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll succeed.</p>



<h2>HELP.</h2>



<p>All of a sudden I noticed that with all these questions, the coolest answer I had got lost in all the noise. In its place came more questions; This time, even more stressful. Do I even want to be an animator? Maybe I just said it to relieve stress? It&#8217;s easier to say I know everything &#8211; it&#8217;s harder to admit I have no clue. And once I lost that truth, I lost my identity.</p>



<p>We all have cornerstone moments in our lives. We will have some during our lifetime, but you can never know when they&#8217;ll arrive. For me, one of these moments was during the premiere of the film &#8220;Zootopia&#8221;. Specifically, the scene where policewoman Judy Hops arrives at Zootopia and sees the city in all its glory; the buildings, the residents, the traffic, the textures &#8211; <strong>the animation!</strong></p>



<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:76%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/4pGwaW3nuRD1e" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/sloth-zootopia-meet-4pGwaW3nuRD1e">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>I got all teary-eyed from the excitement. I found my answer again!<br>At that moment I decided I wanted to create it. Well, not exactly that because it already exists; I wanted to do something like this. Like Pixar. Like Disney. Like Marvel&#8230; Just Farber.<br>Something that will make other people feel the way I felt at that moment.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the post, I mentioned that I am studying animation. As part of our studies, we do workshops, directing, acting, writing, and other interesting film-related mambo-jumbo. We learned to write scripts and watch movies from a director&#8217;s point of view. Suddenly everything connected to me. All the questions I had for my answer led to this conclusion &#8211; I want to be a creator. I want to create stories and share them. I always wanted to be a director, I just didn&#8217;t know it.</p>



<p>That brings me back to the question I asked you at the beginning: Do any of you remember what they wanted to be when they were a child? How many of us really do today what we wanted to do when we were younger?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m just asking because I&#8217;ve been thinking about it lately. I don&#8217;t remember what exactly evoked the association of this moment, but I just remembered when Hadar, my first-grade teacher, asked: &#8220;Who knows what they want to be when they grow-up?&#8221; And one by one everyone answered &#8211; policeman, firefighter, doctor, actress, footballer&#8230; and I shouted with enthusiasm:</p>



<h2>I want to be Batman!</h2>



<p>Hadar smiled. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be Batman. it&#8217;s not a profession.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t?&#8221;<br>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Well, then I want to be a painter!&#8221;</p>



<p>The teacher smiled again.<br>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t paint as a profession.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fast-forward 17 years later, I&#8217;m sitting in my room and come to the conclusion &#8211;<em> fuck</em>. I&#8217;m going to do what I wanted to do when I was a kid. What Hadar, and all the other teachers and responsible adults who came after her, kept telling me &#8211; is a mistake.</p>



<h2>I&#8217;m going to be Batman!</h2>



<p>Now, you&#8217;re probably thinking to yourself &#8220;but you can&#8217;t be Batman.&#8221;<br>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re right. I can&#8217;t be Batman. So if I can&#8217;t be Batman, then I&#8217;ll be Christopher Nolan; only &#8211; Michael Farber. It suits me better.</p>



<p>So I ask you again: Does anyone remember what they wanted to be when they grew up when they were a kid?</p>





<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background is-style-default" style="background-color:#cad0e1;color:#cad0e1"/>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Since I wrote this post&#8230;</h2>



<p>And I kept it on my computer, I started working on an animation with a friend from school, and as a final project and first job as a studio, we created a music video for an Israeli band that garnered more than 80,000 views. I also got to work on interesting projects in the field of directing and acting. This development has inspired and motivated me to publish this post in the group among the abundance of successful posts posted there.</p>



<p>I would still love to know: Does anyone remember what they wanted to be when they grew up when they were a kid? How different is it from what you are doing now?</p>

<p>When I first thought of this post, it was a joke. Literally. I was inspired by a Facebook post titled &#8220;30 conclusions &amp; tips for a 30th birthday&#8221;. The general vibe of the post ranged from dramatic, yet inspiring, to cute and entertaining. I enjoyed reading the post and the tips the author shared, so I thought to myself that it&#8217;s a nice idea to do something similar in honor of my upcoming twenty-fourth birthday. Only the version I thought of was supposed to be filled with jokes and amusing anecdotes &#8211; a form of a parody one might say.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Quick disclaimer</strong><br>This post is heavily influenced by<a href="https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> James Clear&#8217;s original article</a>. If you like it, be sure to show him some love too. Happy reading!</p></blockquote>



<p>Then my twenty-fifth birthday came and went and I still haven’t posted the funny post. Not only have I not written the post, suddenly the post seemed meaningless to me. Is this what I want to do at 25? Just something funny? &#8211; Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like making people laugh, but I&#8217;m sure something more significant can be done in honor of an age that sums up a quarter of a century.</p>



<p>So I decided to do something different. I&#8217;ll write down 25 goals I intend to achieve this year and use this post as a reference. I started searching the web to get inspired and came up with a really interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren Buffett</a> method called &#8220;<em>The 25/5 Technique</em>&#8220;. The same technique he created to achieve personal goals. The method works something like this:</p>



<h2>1. Create a list of everything you want to accomplish</h2>



<p>At this point, you need to create a list of 25 goals/tasks that you want to achieve this year &#8211; without fear and without filtering. Write it all down. Here are some things I wrote down for myself:</p>



<ul><li>Give a lecture</li><li>Learn to play the ukulele</li><li>Write a book</li><li>Go skydiving</li><li>Gain Weight</li><li>Read more books</li></ul>



<p>And so on. As I wrote more and more things I wanted to do, new things emerged that I had not thought of before. All sorts of ideas I&#8217;ve heard from friends over the years and thought to myself &#8220;Ah, cool!&#8221; But I never put too much thought into them. It&#8217;s important not to &#8220;edit&#8221; anything at this point in the list. Just write down whatever comes to mind.</p>



<p>Before I started my life, I wrote down some guidelines. I didn&#8217;t want to write something boring like &#8220;buy an electric scooter&#8221;. When you think about it, buying something is not such an amazing goal (or at all); with a little financial planning, it can be achieved without a lot of problems. So to make sure I write interesting and worth-while goals that will advance me later, I set up these three rules:</p>



<ol><li>It must be an action or an achievement</li><li>It must be something measurable (for example: instead of writing &#8220;read more books&#8221;, write &#8220;read 10 books&#8221;)</li><li>I can&#8217;t list anything that can be obtained by purchasing it</li></ol>



<p>Of course, in your list, you can think of rules that are more suitable for you, but these are great guidelines. still here? Go write some goals!</p>



<h2>2. Choose the 5 most important goals</h2>



<p>Now that we have all our goals written down, we need to go through the list and choose the 5 most important goals. Not the easiest to do &#8211; <strong>the most important ones</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Wait up<br></strong>Before you continue to the next step, you should make sure to finish steps 1 &amp; 2 if you haven&#8217;t already.</p></blockquote>



<h2>3. 20 More to go&#8230;</h2>



<p>So what do we do now that we have the 5 most important goals? Completely ignore the other 20 goals. Yup, I&#8217;m serious. There is nothing more distracting than thinking about other goals that are not the most important. In order not to get lost among all the things I wrote down, I rewrote all my goals, in order of priority. Only when I finish the top 5 tasks will I move on to the next 5 tasks.</p>



<p>Want to read more about Buffett&#8217;s technique? Feel free to read <a href="https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this post by James Clear</a> on the subject.</p>



<p>Looking for some inspiration?</p>



<h2>My 25 goals</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Plans change</strong><br>COVID19 kind of scrambled my plans (like the rest of the world). That&#8217;s I re-organized this list to focus on things I can <em>actually</em> achieve right now, without any countrywide or worldwide limitations.</p></blockquote>



<ol><li><strong>Make this blog profitable</strong></li><li><strong>Earn money from making people laugh</strong></li><li><strong>Publish a book</strong></li><li><strong>Add 10 KG</strong></li><li><strong>Create a community &#8211; at least 50 people</strong><br></li><li>Read 3 books &#8211; with a plot, not self-improvement</li><li>Create 3 animations (2/3)</li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Give a lecture</span></strong></del></li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Publish a digital product</span></strong></del></li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Learn to play 3 songs on a ukulele</span></strong></del></li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Travel to the United States</span></strong></del></li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Return the loan I took for my business</span></strong></del></li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Write a script</span></strong></del></li><li>Go wall climbing &#8211; Reach level 6A</li><li>Learn how to salsa</li><li>Go to a music festival</li><li>Get a scuba license &#8211; 1st star</li><li><del><strong><s><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Get on a stage</span></s></strong></del></li><li>Jump out of an airplane</li><li>Travel to Berlin</li><li><del><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Volunteer &#8211; at least 30 hours</span></strong></del></li><li>Go to (and participate in) a TED event</li><li>Start the Israel road</li><li>Go to Ashram in the desert</li><li><del><span class="has-inline-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color"><strong>Relocate to Argentina</strong></span></del> &#8211; Cancelled</li></ol>



<p>That&#8217;s it. These are the 25 goals I&#8217;m going to keep an eye on for now. Of course, I&#8217;ll only focus on the top five goals of the list. Only when I complete them (or some of them) will I move on to the next goal on the list. Now it&#8217;s your turn to make a list and start achieving your goals! Do you have a cool goal? Do we have a common one? I&#8217;d love to hear about it in the comments!</p>

<p>When I was a young teenager, I discovered porn. It was a magical place that thought me about sex and led to some awkward situations which every teen will come to know at some point. I never thought I could learn from it a thing or two about entrepreneurship.</p>

<p><strong>Before we get into this&#8230;</strong><br>I understand that porn is a touchy subject for some people, especially in 2020. In this post, I&#8217;ll talk about creative solutions from the industry and what we can learn from it. I will not discuss whether it&#8217;s moral, how offensive it is to women (or men), and whether it harms teenagers long term. Those topics deserve a whole post of their own.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>Since I wrote this article, Aria Rose deleted her video about Belle Delphine. Nonetheless, the points I make in this article are still relevant. </p></blockquote>



<p>During an innocent roaming on YouTube, I was recommended to watch a video of Youtube author Aria Rose &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Let's talk about Belle Delphine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPx1wH1DlnY" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s talk about Belle Delphine</a>&#8220;. By that point, I had no idea who Belle Delphine was, but I deducted there might be something wrong with whatever it is she&#8217;s doing. I always like to watch this kind of videos, especially because these are videos that usually present a new perspective or show certain details that I haven&#8217;t taken into account before. The structure is similar across all videos: </p>



<ul><li>Showing the topic (person, case, bill, new product, etc.)</li><li>Discuss the current situation</li><li>Address the problem related to the topic </li><li>Offer possible solutions that were presented so far (or possible solutions offered by the commentator)</li><li>And finally: the personal opinion of the video creator</li></ul>



<p>This type of video can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sxephil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Philip DeFranco's channel (opens in a new tab)">Philip DeFranco&#8217;s channel</a>, where, in addition to news footage from around the world, he creates videos dedicated to a specific topic such as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="murder trial with policy effects (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZgNBWp3fRA" target="_blank">murder trial with policy effects</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="attacks in Yemen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8avr-RiF8g&amp;t=4s" target="_blank">attacks in Yemen</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a new law that could forever change the Internet (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYU77Qqvy-U&amp;t=182s" target="_blank">a new law that could forever change the Internet</a> and other interesting topics.</p>



<p>This time I found myself watching a video regarding cosplayer Bell Delphine. For those unfamiliar with the concept, cosplayers are people who create and dress-up (as the name suggests: Costume-Player) in amazing costumes from pop-culture as a hobby, though many people do it in a professional way, either selling pictures of themselves dresses as popular characters or selling high-quality props and materials for other cosplayers.</p>



<p>My first instinct was to rocket-click the &#8220;skip&#8221; button, until Aria said Delphine charges 25$ for pictures that [Aria] would never pay that amount for (More on that later). My first reaction to that was, <em>&#8220;Well, sure, you&#8217;re probably not the target audience&#8221;</em>, swiftly followed by <em>&#8220;There will always be someone who&#8217;ll consume a product&#8221;</em>. </p>



<p>This brief moment of disagreement inspired this post.</p>



<p>So what can we learn from the Porn Industry?</p>



<h2>1. Haters Gonna Hate</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">God, I love Taylor Swift. Yeah, I&#8217;m a guy and I&#8217;m into the amazing all-American Talyor Swift. Deal with it. But seriously now, in her song &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake It Off</a>&#8221; Taylor says &#8220;<em>Players gonna play, Haters gonna hate, I&#8217;m just gonna shake it off</em>&#8221; (rephrased). Generally speaking, the song talks about how there will always be some people who would doubt and even try to sabotage you. </p>



<p>In the Netflix documentary series &#8220;Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On&#8221; (which was directed and produced by women, by the way) Porn Actor Tyler Knight mentions that <em>&#8220;The same people who judge you, are the same people who consume your product&#8221;</em>. Sure, he says that in reference to the porn industry but that sentence really hit me. </p>

<p>When you&#8217;re trying to work your way up the startup ladder, you notice it quite a lot: people who initially don&#8217;t have faith in you or what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish quickly change their mind when they see a finished product or after being proven the product actually works. When I started with Network Marketing, those people were called &#8220;Dreams Thieves&#8221; (sounds better in Hebrew, but just as tacky) &#8211; People who are frustrated by not succeeding on their own, who are convinced no one can make it in a field they failed at, or people who genuinely believe they have your best in mind but are sure they&#8217;re helping you by not letting take any risks. Obviously, it&#8217;s a very narrow-minded point of view, and those people who give advice sometimes do really know what they&#8217;re talking about. We need to be clear enough to identify when it&#8217;s genuine, founded advice, and when it&#8217;s a baseless personal opinion. </p>



<h2>2. K.I.S.S.</h2>



<p>No, it&#8217;s not an inappropriate invitation for a kiss or a reference to one of the most amazing bands ever existed. It&#8217;s an acronym for one of the most simple principles, cherished by our favorite entrepreneur Steve Jobs &#8211; &#8220;<em>Keeps It Simple, Stupid</em>&#8220;. The phrase, coined by the US Navy back in the &#8217;60s, claims that system work best when they are easy to operate; That&#8217;s why simplicity should be your highest goal when designing a new product, and you should always avoid unnecessary complexity. It makes sense when you think about it.</p>



<p>Porn websites tend to stick to this rule (heard from a friend). They keep the language nice and simple, with a compact and usually friendly user interface.  I know where I should go, where everything is without too much hustle, and what I should do. Sure, not all Pornsites stick to this, but a lot of them do. When thinking about a new product (or a service), we have to make sure the customer understands what they should do at any given moment and they should participate.</p>



<p>Nowadays, Facebook turned into the &#8220;Multi-Platform&#8221;. You can add friends, join groups, attract followers, advertise businesses, and even sell merchandise and offer services. It&#8217;s easy to forget Facebook started as the poor man&#8217;s Tinder: The only option it offered was choosing who&#8217;s hotter between two college students&#8217; pictures, chosen at random. The simplicity of the interface and the interesting concept are what led to Facebook&#8217;s popularity and the popularity of similar apps such as Tinder and Bumble. Simple is easy, and easy is fun.</p>



<h2>3. People Will Pay Every Price*</h2>



<p>&#8230;As long as they feel the product solves a problem or gives them value. A value of a product is dictated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3bdVxuFBs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the value people assign to it</a>. Supply and demand. The whole Wallstreet system is based on this thing. In her video about Delphin, Aria mentions the former&#8217;s Patreon page (a membership platform that provides content creators with different subscription solutions based on levels and rewards). According to Aria, Delphin provides her subscribers with &#8220;sexual pictures, shoutouts, behind the scene footage; typical things for internet stars&#8221;.</p>



<p>The pictures, according to Aria, are always leaked soon after publishing and they&#8217;re not something she&#8217;d pay 25 bucks for. On the other hand, <strong>she&#8217;s not the Target Audience</strong>. Here&#8217;s something very important we need to understand: It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a product or a service, the customer will pay any price written on the label as long as they feel said product or service gives them value or solves a problem they have &#8211; a literal example for this idea can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3bdVxuFBs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Red Paperclip scenario</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="What if you could trade a paperclip for a house? | Kyle MacDonald | TEDxVienna" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8s3bdVxuFBs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Which brings me to lesson number four&#8230;</p>



<h2>4. Always Provide Added Value for Your Customers</h2>



<p>People will consume any content, service, or product that provides them with value. It can be anything, even a funny cat video that has no added value (but let&#8217;s face it: every cat video has enough value for decades). When creating something new for out customers, we need to think <em>&#8220;What is the value of this product for my customer? What added value am I providing my customers with?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>People like to pay for things that make them feel good &#8211; Gadgets, vacations, trips, food, clothes, company, etc. They&#8217;re even more prone to pay for the product when they received an earlier, just as valuable, product from the same supplier &#8211; <strong>for free.</strong> That&#8217;s why the interner is flooded with free eBook this and free sample video that. They buy the customer&#8217;s trust by providing them valuable solutions for free, and only then they offer something that we need to pay for. <em>&#8220;If that&#8217;s what I get for free, boy o boy what would I get if I&#8217;d pay?&#8221;</em>. You get the idea.</p>



<p>The best way to go at it is to think like a customer: </p>



<p>&#8220;What would I&#8217;d be happy to get?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What would I expect from this service?&#8221;</p>



<p>Those questions will lead you to creative ways in which you can provide value to your customers and build your brand effectively.</p>



<h2> 5. Know Your Market and Identify Opportunities </h2>



<p>In 2017, Pornhub, one of the biggest porn websites in the world, produced a brilliant animated video called &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Panda Style (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pornhub.com/cares/panda-style" target="_blank">Panda Style</a>&#8220;, calling viewers to help them save the panda population in the world. The video explains that the pandas&#8217; reluctance to mate in addition to certain conditions that are very difficult to meet puts them on the endangered species list. Convincing the pandas to mate in captivity is even more complicated.</p>



<p>So what can we do about it? Easy. Produce quality porn for pandas around the world so that they would get aroused and get it on with each other. That&#8217;s what Pornhub offered at least &#8211; and they invited viewers to record themselves having sex in panda suits to arouse the pandas (yes, this is real). In addition to this, for every video (and according to the number of views) Pornhub would donate to Panda Conservation Associations around the world.</p>



<p>The campaign garnered supporting articles and videos (because let&#8217;s face it, who doesn&#8217;t like panda bears?), Which increased the buzz surrounding the campaign and initiative, and significantly increased the number of site submissions. There are currently more than 3.2 million video views in the &#8220;Panda Style&#8221; category. So what does this have to do with entrepreneurship? Pornhub found a problem that they could help solve and knew how to do it with the <strong>help of</strong> their audience &#8211; and <strong>for</strong> their audience. I have no doubt that out of these 3.2 million views, a significant percentage of the viewers subscribed to the paid services Pornhub offers and helped increase the site&#8217;s revenue. As entrepreneurs, we need to become very familiar with the market we are entering (or inhabiting), understand who the target audience is and what their needs are, and how I (or my brand) can meet those needs.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Porn is a provocative industry, there&#8217;s no way around it. It raises moral and psychological arguments we should explore, but it doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t have anything to teach us &#8211; For better or for worse. Like any industry, there are positive parts and negative parts, and it&#8217;s our job as consumers, entrepreneurs, and just human beings &#8211; to open our eyes and understand what we agree with, and what we don&#8217;t,. and more importantly &#8211; What can we learn and how can we improve.</p>

<p>I used to struggle with money. Always lamenting I don't have more of it. What I didn't realize was that the secret to it all wasn't what I'm doing, or how I'm doing it, but what I'm thinking and HOW I was thinking about it.</p>

<p>It is said that the first tool of mankind was a stick. The first man (or the first <em>ape</em>, more probably) to lift a stick used it for distance management. Either to get something they couldn&#8217;t reach on their own closer to them or to keep a safe distance between themselves and something new they don&#8217;t fully understand yet. The second tool was the rope, which we used to secure things that were important to us; whether that something is things we found, animals we&#8217;ve caught, or even people.</p>



<p>Very quickly these useful tools became weapons &#8211; we understood how to turn a simple stick into a spear or even an arrow. We used the rope to enslave people we thought were lower than us on the social ladder. Eventually, we created a powerful tool that was an important part of the survival of the Homo-Sapiens. We invented <em>Language</em>. So why are we so insistent on turning this into a weapon as well?</p>



<h2>We&#8217;re not the best</h2>



<p>Homo-Sapiens were not the only humans on the planet. They were also not the strongest &#8211; Homo-Sapiens literally means &#8220;smart man&#8221; in Latin. There were two elements that distinguished them from other species: creativity and language. <strong>Creativity</strong> and the <strong>need for innovation</strong> led them to explore their world; Discover new places and multiply across the planet. <strong>Language </strong>helped them create useful collaborations that were crucial to their survival. These two elements together have given Homo-Sapiens the capability for complex design and spread new ideas between one person and another. Like any tool that has ever fallen into the hands of Homo-Sapiens, language can also be destructive if one chooses to use it in that way.</p>



<p>Language has a lot of power that we tend to take for granted. A sentence said in the heat of the moment can shatter a relationship. A word accidentally thrown at a wrong child can scar them for life. I&#8217;m sure that as you were reading this, some memories of things that were said and negatively impacted you resurfaced. It&#8217;s not fun, and in some cases extremely difficult to forget.</p>



<h2>The choice is ours</h2>



<p>Like any other tool we use, <em>we</em> are responsible for how we actually use it. Sometimes we use Language in a particularly ineffective way without paying attention; Like a kid trying to cut a salad for the first time and not knowing how to hold a knife. He might do a great job and nothing would happen &#8211; or he might hurt himself. The same is true with our thoughts and what we say out loud. We formulate thoughts with words that are not the most positive in the world and say words without thinking. We&#8217;ll do this enough and it will begin to affect the way we act or the way we react to unpleasant situations. In short &#8211; we&#8217;re suckers. Wasting energy and time that we could have used to our advantage.</p>

<p>Obviously, I&#8217;ve made that mistake too. I still do sometimes. It works automatically for most of us. Throughout the first year of running my business, there was a constant thought that came back again and again &#8211; &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t have enough money</em>&#8220;. Another thought that kept accompanying me was &#8220;<em>This is hard</em>&#8220;. Not the most positive frame of thought. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Dyer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Dyer</a> once said &#8220;What you think about &#8211; expands&#8221;, and that&#8217;s exactly what happened. I was having such a bad time financially and was considering giving up and closing my business altogether. I was so focused on the problem that I couldn&#8217;t even think of a solution. I would probably have missed it even that magic solution would start dancing in front of my face.</p>



<h2>Like trying to run with giant rocks attached to your shoes</h2>



<p>I quickly realized that something was wrong. Not necessarily in what I&#8217;m doing &#8211; but in the way I&#8217;m thinking. People don&#8217;t say thoughts create your reality for nothing. I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Secret</a>&#8221; or being positive. It&#8217;s way more than that. It has to do with changing what your brain is concentrating on. The things it&#8217;s sensitive to and is unconsciously searching for.</p>



<p>If I think “I have no money” over and over again, I only reinforce the reality where I have no money and that there&#8217;s nothing to do about it. You probably have a similar thought of your own that is constantly reinforcing a negative state of mind. Maybe you think &#8220;I have not money&#8221; too. But it&#8217;s not exclusive to money problems. We think about negative aspects of ourselves all the time and we don&#8217;t even notice; &#8220;I&#8217;m not talented&#8221;; &#8220;I don&#8217;t get along with *insert someone&#8217;s name here*; &#8220;I&#8217;m not good enough&#8221;; &#8220;I&#8217;m miserable&#8221;. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not lacking in the negative thoughts department. The funny thing is, that some of those thoughts (if not all of them) are actually groundless but they&#8217;re still insanely powerful. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a video that perfectly illustrates this idea:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Test Your Awareness: Do The Test" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ahg6qcgoay4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>The solution I found</h2>



<p>Our language, the way we formulate our thoughts &#8211; affects the way we act and react. Because of this, instead of thinking &#8220;<em>I <strong>have no</strong> money</em>&#8221; I changed my perception and started asking myself &#8220;<em><strong>How do I get</strong> money?</em>&#8220;. Very quickly I found myself drowning in opportunities for very nice profits. My reality didn&#8217;t change &#8211; my <em>perception</em> did. I re-calibrated my mind to be sensitive to income opportunities. I was very excited about this trick so I started asking more questions:</p>



<ul><li><em>&#8220;How do I get more customers?&#8221;</em></li><li><em>&#8220;What else can I offer?&#8221;</em></li><li><em>&#8220;How do I grow the business?&#8221;</em></li></ul>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t before long that I received the answers to my questions. I don&#8217;t think I would have evolved so much in the last few years if I had&#8217;t asked myself these questions. Questions, by the way, that I also asked in the personal and social space. I started asking myself:</p>



<ul><li><em>&#8220;How do I treat my parents? How can I help them?&#8221;</em></li><li><em>&#8220;What am I looking for in a partner, and how do I find her?&#8221;</em></li><li><em>&#8220;Am I as good a friend as I want to be?&#8221;</em></li></ul>



<p>I came up with interesting breakthroughs in my relationships, from extraordinary openness with friends to rebuilding relationships that I thought were ruined forever. All because I asked myself the right questions, and made a conscious effort to communicate effectively and positively with the people around me.</p>



<p>Language is the most powerful tool we&#8217;ve ever created or will ever create. It controls the nature of our relationships, sets thought patterns, and leads to action &#8211; or inaction. That is why if we know how to use language effectively, we&#8217;ll reach amazing breakthroughs in our lives.</p>



<h2>Your turn!</h2>



<p>What negative thought patterns are repeated in your head? What significant change has happened in your life from a simple change in perception? I would love to hear all about it in the comments 🙂</p>

<p>Lately a few friends of mine have shared with me situations where they felt nervous, impatient and sometimes even reacted unpleasantly to the people around them. I was able to find a common denominator: no one knew how to explain how they felt and everyone described impatience in one way or another.</p>

<p>I talked to my friends recently about the H.A.L.T. principle, which helps us identify emotional triggers. &#8216;What is an emotional trigger&#8217; you ask? Well, an emotional trigger a physical or environmental state (or situation) that leads to a specific emotional reaction. It may be anxiousness, impatience, impulsivity and other fun feelings we have.</p>



<p>The cool thing about this is that once we identify the right emotional trigger (which is the first step in solving a problem &#8211; realizing you have one), we can avoid it or even better &#8211; deal with it effectively. </p>



<h2>&#8220;HALT! Who goes there?&#8221;</h2>



<p>More like &#8220;<em>what</em> is going on&#8221;. Here&#8217;s where the H.A.L.T. principle comes into play: the goal is to notice which one of the four emotional triggers we&#8217;re dealing with. H.A.L.T. is an acronym for Hungry, Angry, Lonely &amp; Tired; four physiological states that may lead to negative emotions or at least make you feel uneasy. When we notice these negative emotions, we should ask ourselves four simple questions:</p>



<h2>1. Am I hungry?</h2>



<p>If we keep working the whole day without eating, we may feel week and low on energy. Hunger can affect our attention span and make us feel cranky. no wonder babies are always crying&#8230; So the simple thing we have to do is just stop what we&#8217;re doing and get a bite to eat. It&#8217;ll calm us down and give us energy to continue with our day.</p>



<h2>2. Am I Angry?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s not healthy to bottle things up. Remember the last time that annoying song got stuck in your head? yeah, that happens with thoughts and feelings too. Dealing with that anger, whether that be talking about it with your peers or just taking it out on a treadmill, is important for your well being. And if dealing with that anger is not possible at the moment, you can always use good ol&#8217; fashioned distraction. Most important: breath.</p>



<h2>3. Am I lonely?</h2>



<p>Loneliness can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. It may screw up your motivation and just blow your energy out the window. There&#8217;s a reason humans thrive in social environments: we&#8217;re social beings, and we <em>need</em> to interact with each other. Sometimes all it takes is a phone call to make yourself feel better, or better yet: go out with someone and have some fun 🙂</p>



<h2>4. Am I tired?</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no way around it: we need sleep. I know that feeling you get when you try to convince yourself that one little all-nighter wouldn&#8217;t hurt, but science would say otherwise. It takes your body at least four days to return to its normal biological cycle, and until that happens we may feel dizzy, impatient on constantly on a verge of going on a killing spree if someone dares to speak before we had our morning coffee. Don&#8217;t go on killing spree. Have some sleep instead. </p>



<p>So the next time you feel uneasy, maybe one of these emotional triggers is the culprit. Just halt and ask yourself these four simple questions. You&#8217;ll astound yourself by how easy is it so feel balanced again.</p>

<h2>I&#8217;m watching you!</h2>



<p>Big woop. If you don&#8217;t know by now that everybody and their mama are watching you on the internet, boy&#8230; I have some news for you. Information is the currency of the 21st century and I&#8217;m a common beggar. With that power, comes great responsibili&#8211; kidding. But there are laws put in place to protect your private information so that we don&#8217;t become this all-knowing public domain utopia. </p>



<p>Every website you visit follows you and your action (online). My lawyer told me I have to have this policy here, explaining how I collect, store &amp; use your information, who I share it with, and when I delete it. So if I <em>have to</em> have this legal document, I&#8217;m going to do it with style. </p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>So listen, it&#8217;s 2020, content writing exists and there&#8217;s absolutely no reason having a document that&#8217;s written so boringly and annoying. Don&#8217;t worry, this document is <em>still</em> legally binding, it just doesn&#8217;t completely suck the life out of you after reading the first paragraph. You might even learn a thing or two.</p></blockquote>

</div></div>



<h2>Ok, Google</h2>



<p>So get this &#8211; You know how Google is this search engine giant and just a modern-day Skynet waiting to happen? (just kidding, G. Don&#8217;t sue me). They also provide this cool tool (haha, cool tool. It&#8217;s funny because it rhimes): <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/features/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Analytics</a>, which is the main analytics service I use on this website. You&#8217;re probably using it too if you have a website of your own. You can know more about it from this sweet little video:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>This service also uses gluten-free digital &#8220;Cookies&#8221;, which are text files that the website places on your computer, that helps Google Analytics know you are you, and that you visited my website. It&#8217;s kind of like a name badge on orientation day, but for your browser and without any personal information, which is actually prohibited practice by its own privacy policy. That&#8217;s right &#8211; You&#8217;re just numbers to me (still love you, though).</p>



<p>This text file helps me analyze how users use the website, and the information gathered will be transmitted to Google and stored on their hands-on servers in the US. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to conduct reports on website activity, which I may review, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet use. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Fun Fact: Everything expires. Even this cookie.</strong><br>Yes, for real. The cookie will stay on your computer for 24 months unless you delete it manually. Every time you enter my website, the expiration date of this delicious information cookie will lengthen for 24 additional months. I wish it was the same every time I open my Capn&#8217; Crunch cereal box.</p></blockquote>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the information generated by the &#8220;cookie&#8221; file on your computer:</p>



<ul><li>Your IP address</li><li>Your browser type &amp; version</li><li>Your operating system</li><li>Internet service provider </li><li>When you visited my website and for how long</li><li>The pages you visited on my website</li><li>Referring pages &amp; websites</li><li>Outgoing pages &amp; websites</li><li>How many time you clicked your mouse and other details</li><li>Your age &amp; gender group (if it knows them)</li><li>Where you were when visiting my website, (in approximate accuracy)</li><li>Different actions you&#8217;ve made like subscribing to my newsletter or filling out the contact form</li></ul>



<p>I hate to be a party pooper, but my lawyer would kill me if I didn&#8217;t mention that Google may transfer all this information to other people when the law requires it, or if other people process this information on Google&#8217;s behalf.</p>

It&#8217;s important to note that if you choose to do that, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the website because life&#8217;s not fair. But also because the system I use would lack important information. By using this site, you agree that your data is being processed by Google.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="90" src="https://thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/incognito-cookies.jpg" alt="cookies in incognito mode" class="wp-image-15198" srcset="https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/incognito-cookies.jpg 660w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/incognito-cookies-300x41.jpg 300w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/incognito-cookies-600x82.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>By the way, you can always browse the internet using incognito mode and limit the use of cookies on sites you visit. Any cookies created while browsing in incognito mode will be deleted when you close your browser window. Cool, huh?</p>



<h2>Tag! You&#8217;re it!</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m also using <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/features/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Tag Manager</a>, which is another service by Google that allows me to implement different codes on the website (more on that in a sec), and create different events for tracking your behavior on this website (like which links you clicked on, or how far have you scrolled on specific pages for example). Those events and tracking codes might change from time to time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="150" src="https://thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tracking-codes.jpg" alt="tracking code icons" class="wp-image-15136" srcset="https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tracking-codes.jpg 660w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tracking-codes-300x68.jpg 300w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tracking-codes-600x136.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>Beyond the analytics code embedded in all pages of the site, I use additional tracking codes, such as Facebook Pixels, Google Ads conversion codes, or other codes of other platforms as long as they&#8217;re relevant to the operation, marketing, and maintenance of this website.</p>



<h2>How comments work around here</h2>



<p>The Far Bear philosophy is all about community. I wanted to make it as easy as possible to take part in the different conversations that this blog offer, without risking the articles to be spammed. Therefore you have the possibility to log in using an existing social media account, either on Facebook or Google. If you choose to connect using one of these services, the website will automatically create a user for you, using the email address, full name, and profile picture used on your social media account. Keep in mind that you have the option to delete individual comments you&#8217;ve made and manage subscriptions to other user&#8217;s comments &amp; users you follow, and you can always delete your account on this website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="288" src="https://thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comments-settings.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15194" srcset="https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comments-settings.jpg 660w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comments-settings-300x131.jpg 300w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comments-settings-600x262.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><figcaption>You can delete individual comments you&#8217;ve made, manage subscriptions for comments other users have made and manage the users you follow. You cal also bulk edit this info.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s say you chose <em>not</em> to connect using one of the social platforms mentioned, you can always comment as a guest using your Email address as verification. When you comment as a guest, an anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you&#8217;re using it &#8211; here&#8217;s the <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gravatar service privacy policy</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you comment as an existing user or as a guest, every time you comment I collect (well, not me specifically, a computer does that) the data shown in the comments form, and also your IP address and browser user agent string to help detect spam. If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so I can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. After your comment is approved by yours truly, your profile picture will be visible to the public in the context of what you wrote in your comment.</p>



<h2>Subscribing to my newsletter</h2>



<p>Once you subscribe to my newsletter, your Email address will be automatically added to a list of people who are interested in receiving content from me. This content may be news about this site, updates when new content arrives, and offers for free stuff or for purchasing. If you subscribe to my newsletter, you approve you want me to send you this content. It&#8217;s pretty common sense, actually. </p>



<p>Listen, I hate spam like any other guy, so I&#8217;ll do my best to respect your trust and offer only things I believe you might be interested in or that can provide value to you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Not interested in hearing from me anymore? No problem.</strong><br>Heartbreak aside, you can always opt-out of the mailing list using the &#8220;Unsubscribe Me&#8221; link which is located at the bottom of every Email I send out.</p></blockquote>



<p>To store your Email information and evaluate open &amp; close statistics, I&#8217;m using a third-party service, called &#8220;<a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/invite/14580b74c54c5" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">MailerLite</a>&#8220;. Their UI is great and the system is pretty easy to use. If you think about starting your own mailing list, MailerLite would be a safe bet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="700" src="https://thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/statistics-report-page-mailerlite-1.jpg" alt="MailerLite statistics" class="wp-image-15131" srcset="https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/statistics-report-page-mailerlite-1.jpg 850w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/statistics-report-page-mailerlite-1-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/statistics-report-page-mailerlite-1-768x632.jpg 768w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/statistics-report-page-mailerlite-1-600x494.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<p>By the way, I will never ask you to send me your password or any credit card information by Email. So if you receive this type of message, don&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s called a phishing scam, and it&#8217;s done by bad people to trick you into sending them information that will help them steal your money or other valuable data. Please let me know if this happens and report it in your Email service.</p>



<h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>



<p>From time to time, I&#8217;ll use embedded content (like videos, images, articles, audio files, GIFs, etc.). The embedded content behaves as if you&#8217;ve visited the original website I embedded it from. This means that those websites may collect data about you, use cookies of their own (copycats&#8230;), embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with the embedded content. Also, if you&#8217;re logged in to that other website, it may track your interaction with that particular piece of content as one of their users.</p>



<h2>What can you do with your data</h2>



<p>Got an account on this website? left some comments? first of all &#8211; thanks! but you should know you can always ask for an exported file of the personal data I have about you, including details provided by you. Keep in mind that this data can always be deleted by request. Unfortunately, some data I cannot erase &#8211; that includes data that I&#8217;m obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. </p>



<h3>How we protect your data</h3>



<p>You probably know your way around the internet by now, but for legal purposes (and also some educational ones), let&#8217;s assume you have no clue when it comes to internet protocols. When you browse the web, depending on the website you&#8217;re visiting, your computer uses different communication protocols (set of rules that allows two or more parties to communicate with each other). </p>



<p>HTTP is probably the most widely used protocol in the world today. It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is used for viewing web pages.  However, this website uses HTTPS, which stands for <strong>Secured</strong> HTTP, to protect the data transmitted in and out of the pages you&#8217;re visiting. Whenever you visit a secured website, you&#8217;ll see this cute little lock icon next to that website&#8217;s address. Depending on your browser, It will look kind of like this:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="60" src="https://thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HTTPS-example-1.jpg" alt="SSL example" class="wp-image-15169" srcset="https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HTTPS-example-1.jpg 660w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HTTPS-example-1-300x27.jpg 300w, https://www.thefarbear.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HTTPS-example-1-600x55.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t a bullet-proof solution (which any security expert would agree), and I cannot guarantee 100% security coverage. If you decide to consume any of the content on this website anyway, you should know you&#8217;re doing it at your own risk. As a general rule of thumb, you should always make sure to responsibly secure your account.</p>



<h2>Where am I keeping all this data</h2>



<p>Every website needs a hosting service, and mine&#8217;s no different. I&#8217;m using a hosting service called &#8220;<a href="http://namecheap.pxf.io/farbrco" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Namecheap</a>&#8221; and store the information on their servers (this giant computer that stores information). By its definition, a hosting <strong>service</strong> takes care of the hardware I&#8217;m technically renting, the software those servers use, and everything else related to storage and security.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Set up your website in under a minute with EasyWP" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yoTI3O4xS3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The servers hosting all The Far Bear stuff right now are located in New-York. I&#8217;ve never been there, but I heard it&#8217;s quite an experience. I chose to store this website and its information on Namecheap&#8217;s servers because I have personal experience with their services and I trust them. By consuming the Far Bear content and purchasing items on this website, you agree that your information is being stored the big apple. It&#8217;s important to note that I (or Namecheap) may move things to other places in the US, but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; this change won&#8217;t affect your experience. </p>



<h2>In case something changes</h2>



<p>I might change this super fun privacy policy in the future. If I make any profound changes to it though, I will let you know via newsletter update and allow you to decide if you agree with them. Just to make sure, I will update the cookie policy pop-up and make sure it&#8217;s properly visible. This update will be live for 30 days, after which I will restore it to the default design and content.</p>



<h2>Let&#8217;s talk</h2>



<p>You can contact me via Email at michael@farbr.co. Nope, not .com, .co.<br>Shout-out to <a href="https://summurai.com/Blog/summurai-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Summurai</a> for the inspiration for this post. </p>



<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>You know how every website or service these days has their own boring version of a terms-of-use document that nobody likes (or wants) to read? Well, this is mine. Enjoy!</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thefarbear.blog/terms-of-use/">Mandatory Boring Legal Stuff: The Far Bear Terms of Use</a> was written by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thefarbear.blog/author/f4rbrc0/">Michael Farber</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thefarbear.blog/terms-of-use/">Mandatory Boring Legal Stuff: The Far Bear Terms of Use</a> first appeared on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thefarbear.blog">The Far Bear Philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re browsing this website, that means you accept the terms of this website. Don&#8217;t agree? That&#8217;s fine. But you should also exit this website, stop using any of its services, and avoid purchasing any of its products. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to turn off the lights when you leave. Sorry. </p>



<p><strong>In lawyerly people language: </strong>this is a legal agreement between you (AKA &#8220;The Visitor&#8221;) and me ( AKA Michael Farber, &#8220;The Far Bear&#8221;) &#8211; the owner and creator of this website and its services.</p>



<h2>My house &#8211; My rules</h2>



<p>I can (and sometimes will) change the terms of service and privacy policy whenever I want. I may also stop offering things, change things, or restrict access to different things, without any notice. That includes changing, suspending, or deleting your account &#8211; or account information &#8211; in case you have one on this website.</p>



<p>You know how when you&#8217;re a kid you have to ask to be excused from the dinner table? Yeah, there&#8217;s none of that here. If I see a user who does not comply with the terms of this agreement, or if I believe that a user violated these terms, I will be entitled to terminate that user’s activity on my services in any form I see fit (my house, remember?).</p>



<h2>What you see is what you get</h2>



<p>You may use this site and its contents AS IS, at your own risk. <br>There&#8217;s no warranty for anything here. This ain&#8217;t no Amazon Prime.</p>



<h2>I&#8217;m only human</h2>



<p>What I mean by that is that I can&#8217;t be responsible for everything all the time. Especially on the great and vast interweb. So If I provide any links in the website, I can&#8217;t guarantee they will be correct and will lead to active websites. You might think the content on those websites or articles to be offensive, inappropriate or just plain horrible in any other regard. Nonetheless, I take no responsibility for any content on, or any feelings you may have that resulted from, any links on this website. </p>



<p>Point is &#8211; this is the internet. There are some messed up things out there. None of is on me.</p>



<p>Oh, and another thing to remember: <strong>I am <em>not</em> a trained professional.</strong> Keep that in mind when reading, using, or relying on any information found in this website or other websites that were linked to in different articles on this website.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Make no mistake:</strong><br>I am not responsible for any damage, to you or anything else, that was caused because of the information on this website.</p></blockquote>



<h2>The Far Bear brand, content and activity on the website</h2>



<p>In case it&#8217;s not already clear, I own everything in this joint. In other words, I own the full legal rights for the visual elements you see, the text content you read, and audio files you may choose to listen to (you should, objective feedback would be great). I know you don&#8217;t mean any harm, but just in case: I don&#8217;t allow you to use, copy, adapt any part of the written code or visual elements, without getting a written agreement. </p>



<p>Just do me a favor, don&#8217;t be a jerk, okay? The internet has enough of them as it is. </p>



<h3>Content Published On This Website By Users</h3>



<ul><li>I&#8217;m a strong supporter of freedom of speech, but I&#8217;m also a strong advocate for avoiding jail. So don&#8217;t do, say, post, share, or comment any type of content with sexual or illegal nature. Also, don&#8217;t spam.<br></li><li>In case someone posted something on this website that violates the clause above, including links to third parties, it&#8217;s important to note I take no responsibility for that content. I do, however, feel obligated to point out that that person is a little shit. Yeah, I said it. You all know what I&#8217;m talking about.<br></li><li>Don&#8217;t do anything that might hurt me, my brand, my websites, or my precious visitors&#8217; experience. <br></li><li>This is the internet. Everything you post here is public. Keep that in mind when posting or commenting on this website (or any other website for that matter). I can&#8217;t (and won&#8217;t) take responsibility for anything you post online, or for anything that happens to you because of something you posted online. </li></ul>



<h2>No one&#8217;s above the law, partner</h2>



<p>If a user has violated the terms of this agreement, I will be entitled to disclose every detail known to me about them in any legal proceedings. You know what? I might do that even if I don&#8217;t receive a court order instructing me to so. It&#8217;s nothing personal, just self-preservation. </p>



<h2>Yo, where you at?</h2>



<p>Tel-Aviv, Israel is an amazing city. Sandy beaches, cloudy skies and asphalty roads. You should come visit me here sometime. It&#8217;s also where all suits arising from the content and services provided in this website must take place. Did I mention that the terms of use are governed by Israeli law? Because these terms of use are governed by Israeli law.</p>



<h2>No one likes a wise-ass&#8230;</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s say some judge somewhere decided that something in this agreement is wrong. If that&#8217;s ever to happen, I will still take the rest of this agreement seriously and consider it as valid, and you should too.</p>



<h2>That&#8217;s a wrap</h2>



<p>This super long text document (it wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> long, wasn&#8217;t it?) represents the agreement between you and me. I promise I&#8217;m usually more fun than this. </p>



<p>If you want to ask me something or just share a really funny bloopers video, you can send an email to michael@farbr.co . I&#8217;d love to hear from you 🙂</p>

<p>I spent the last two months in a small town in the US called Bayfield, where I acted as a counselor in a science summer camp. I came to teach the campers about UX design and animation, and ended up learning a whole lot about communication, the importance of a team, and leadership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thefarbear.blog/leadership-is-a-choice/">Herald Or A Sheep: Leadership Is A Choice</a> first appeared on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thefarbear.blog">The Far Bear Philosophy</a>.</p>

<h2>&#8220;I am just a sheep herald.&#8221;</h2>



<p>Those were the first words Moses said when God asked him to save the Israelites from Pharoah. &#8220;I am not up to the task,&#8221; Moses said. Even when God assured him he would not be alone and that God is by his side, Moses continued;</p>



<p>&#8220;What if they don&#8217;t believe me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why should Pharoah listen to me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>We all know how Moses’ story ended. Many leaders throughout history have said things like this to the people around them &#8211; and themselves &#8211; right until they became the leaders they were born to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years ago, I took part in a communication workshop, led by a coach named David. During the workshop, we were divided into small groups, and each group chose its group leader. I was one of the few who were chosen by their groups, and frankly, I did not feel like I was up to the task. Once a week, all the group leaders had a conference call with David to give an update on our groups’ status and receive support and advice from other group leaders.</p>



<p>One night I decided to stay in the call after everyone has left until it was just David and me. “Hey David,” I said, “Do you think you can choose someone else to lead my group? I don’t think I’m the right person for this job. I don’t feel like a Leader.”</p>



<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:79%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/zFFv5A37Y8gdW" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/zFFv5A37Y8gdW">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>David didn’t say anything for a few moments. I could hear him taking a deep breath before he decided to speak… “How is being a Leader suppose to feel like?”</p>



<p>Silence. I had no idea how to answer that question; “I don’t know.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then how do you know you’re not a leader?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Touche, David.</p>



<p>“I don’t know. I just feel like it’s not me. I’m not a leader.” It amazes me that even after serving three years in the Israeli Defence Forces, even after serving as a commander and commanding over 200+ soldiers during my service, I still doubted myself. Fortunately, David knew exactly what to say to me, even if it did catch me off guard;</p>



<p>“Do you know the story of Jonah?”</p>



<p>“You mean the one with the whale?” I asked.</p>



<p>“That’s right,” David said, “God asked Jonah to warn the people of an evil city that if they would not stop their evil ways the city would be destroyed. Did he do that?”</p>



<p>“Well, not at first. Jonah tried to run away from his mission. He didn’t think people would listen to him.” I was utterly oblivious to where David was going with this, but I decided to stay for the ride.</p>



<p>“That’s right,” David continued, “And when a storm started, Jonah knew it was because he angered God. He took responsibility for his mistake and the people of the ship threw him overboard, where a whale swallowed him. After three days, Jonah came out of the whale alive and well, and continued to do his mission.”</p>



<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l2Jedbtii3CQASrza" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/season-16-the-simpsons-16x8-l2Jedbtii3CQASrza">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>I was trying to figure out what was David talking about.</p>



<p>Then he asked, “Why do you think he did that?”</p>



<p>“Because God told him to.”</p>



<p>“It was the catalyst but not the reason. The real reason was he was a leader. That was his true calling and that is why God chose him for this mission. So when do you think Jonah became a leader?”</p>



<p>David knew to ask the right questions at the right moment.</p>



<p>“When he chose to,” I said.</p>



<p>“Do you see my point?” David asked. I did see it. People have this weird natural urge to doubt themselves, which can be a good thing sometimes. However, it can stop us from doing the right thing; something we’re meant to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So after a few courses, two years in college, and some trips to Europe, I got to a point where I ran my own workshops and running my own business. During these workshops, and even afterward, I kept surprising myself and always reaching heights. After a while, I decided it was time for me to finally be a counselor in a summer camp and lead young campers (and also make sure they’re having a lot of fun!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leadership is hard, and sometimes people don’t want to take all that responsibility upon themselves, which is perfectly ok. To make sure I’m always on the right path, I’ve implemented three simple guidelines:</p>



<h2>1. Be the last to speak</h2>



<p>Many people like to assume control of the room to share their own opinion. As a leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to assume control of the room to make sure it is spread equally across the room.</p>



<h2>2. Be the first to share</h2>



<p>Originally ‘Be the first to <em>Act</em>’, this guideline was born out of the notion that we develop relationships by sharing experience, stories, and feelings. But in reality, it can be hard (or at least uncomfortable) to share something with another person. When people share with us, it becomes easier for us to share something back because they made the first move.</p>



<h2>3. Be Kind</h2>



<p>It’s hard to be mean or to be angry at someone who is kind to you. Don’t get me wrong; it’s not a technique or manipulation. It’s just a basic understanding that some people are this way because they are missing some kindness in their lives. Most of the time, it helps make someone’s day a little brighter. Remember: There’s no such thing as a <em>small</em> act of kindness. Kindness, by its nature, is Contagious.</p>



<p>Choosing to be someone who empowers others can sometimes be challenging, and that is why I’ve adopted these guidelines. It’s easy to stray from the right track. So easy, that during my time in the army, we had this saying about commanders:</p>

<p>So how do we know when we’re ready to lead?</p>

<p>Back in the army, I used to give professional technical lessons as a commander. It sounds big, but in reality I was teaching young kids to be a PC Admin. Nothing glorious about it. In the beginning I wasn&#8217;t very confident and sometimes I felt the urge to prove myself to my soldiers, even though I already had the authority. When I left the army, I left that professional life behind and looked for a more artistic profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few years working as a UX Designer and dealing with anxiety, I created &#8220;The Shield&#8221;; a workshop designed to help people who deal with stress and anxiety on a daily basis. Very much like myself. The whole workshop was based on my own personal experience plus some techniques and conclusions I got along the way. Naturaly, I posted all about it on my Facebook profile.</p>


<h2>The Invitation</h2>



<p>A friend of mine, who was my initiate in the army, saw one of these posts regarding the workshop and called me right away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey Mike, what&#8217;s the deal with that workshop you just published?&#8221; she asked. I told her about her all about the workshop, and how the only reason it even exists is that many people urged me to share my personal experience since they felt it helped them and might help many others in the same situation.</p>



<p>My friend told me about the everyday stress her soldiers have to deal with, and that her unit lacks activities like this one.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you mind coming here and share the workshop with the soldiers?&#8221; </p>



<p>I was actually hoping she&#8217;d ask something like this. I don&#8217;t why, but I have a soft spot for soldiers. I said &#8216;yes&#8217; and after that everything was arranged very quickly.</p>



<h2>The Day of The Workshop</h2>



<p>Two months and one trip to Argentina-and-back later, the day of the workshop arrived. I came prepared with my laptop and extra notebooks, just in case. My friend waited for me a projector, her own copies of the notebooks (which I&#8217;ve sent a few weeks before) and a brand new classroom for me to use. Looking at my friend as a commander, who I remembered as a soldier, was astounding.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, this kind of feels like &#8216;closure&#8217;, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She said, with a voice so excited. I agreed with every word. It wasn&#8217;t the base I served in, but something about this place turned on this nostalgic feeling.</p>



<p>Slowly but surely, the classroom was filled with bored young soldiers. To their credit, they were very patient waiting for their peers to take their seats. Some were talking with each other, others were on the phone, but every single one of them said &#8216;hello&#8217; when they entered the door. Some of them took advantage of the extra time to look at the picture projected on the wall and go through the notebook real quick.</p>



<p>When everyone was seated the workshop started, a flood of memories came rushing in, like a flashback in a movie. But this time something was different. I wasn&#8217;t as anxious as I was at the beginning of my role in the army. I didn&#8217;t even felt that urge to &#8220;prove myself&#8221; to the other soldiers. I found myself lost in the moment and decided to go with it.</p>



<p>Throughout the workshop, we had many interesting discussions, which only made the experience more enjoyable. Every new conversation reminded me how much I love to stand in front of an audience and share what I know, and how much I appreciate a discussion that challenges your thought.</p>



<h2>And just like that, it was over.</h2>



<p>Everyone stood up and exited the room. Some of them shook my hand, some settled for a polite head nod. I could hear the words &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome&#8221; and &#8220;My pleasure&#8221; coming out of my mouth but all I could think about was that very first lesson as a commander, and the long road I&#8217;ve been on since I left the army.</p>



<p>I almost couldn&#8217;t believe what I&#8217;ve accomplished throughout this long short-journey of mine. Accomplishments I took for granted suddenly came back to stare right at me. I couldn&#8217;t help but think about Steve Jobs&#8217; speech about &#8216;connecting the dots&#8217;. The speech where he talks about how you go through so many things in your life, that seems like have nothing to do with each other, but when you look back &#8211; it all makes sense.</p>



<p>And when I thought about the workshop I gave at that military base, I thought it was fun. I was exhausting. It was closure. You need to stop every now and then and look back at what you&#8217;ve accomplished. Sometimes it&#8217;s very easy to miss you&#8217;ve come so far.</p>



<p>When they all left the classroom and thanked me, I should have stopped each and every one of them, and instead of saying &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome&#8221;, what I should have said was:</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank <em>you</em>&#8220;.</p>
